# Sixle

*Vintage 2025 — A finely crafted digital diversion*

---

### Tasting Notes
Sixle is a word game of rare elegance, drawing on the noble tradition of Wordle yet maturing gracefully into its own bouquet. With six letters per guess, each play reveals layers of complexity, unfolding across a grid as measured and deliberate as the notes in a fine symphony.  

Hints of **strategy**, **luck**, and **linguistic curiosity** intermingle, revealing themselves slowly — letter by letter — with each turn. Victories are punctuated by confetti bursts, while losses leave a lingering tannic reminder: sometimes the word eludes even the most discerning palate.

### Vineyard & Terroir
- **Grapes:** React, TypeScript, and ConfettiJS, nurtured carefully in the soils of Create React App.  
- **Aging:** Rested and bottled in GitHub Pages for global enjoyment.  
- **Body:** 6 guesses per game, each structured around 6-letter words.  
- **Finish:** A smooth balance of challenge and delight, equally suited to mobile and desktop pairings.

### Pairings
- Best enjoyed with a morning coffee, a glass of evening wine, or in convivial company over shared screens.  
- Complements the company of other word games but stands proudly on its own.

Every bottle (build) of Sixle is hand-crafted:  
- **All Words**: an expansive dictionary for validation.

- **Responsive Design**: structured to adapt gracefully, whether served on tall goblets (desktops) or petite flutes (mobiles).
